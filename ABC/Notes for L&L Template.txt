This template is a modification of the Solace template by Solace Software.  This was then sold to Radfusion who then placed it into the public domain in 2010.

This modified template is provided as is and you choose to use it at your own risk.  

I recommend that you fully test this before you deploy it as part of your solutions.

I plan to continue to modify the template to more fully integrate with L&L.
